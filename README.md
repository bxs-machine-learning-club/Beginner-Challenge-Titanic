# Beginner Challenge: Titanic
Task: Develop a model with the highest accuracy possible. Use an sklearn pipeline for preprocessing and model selection and engineer some novel features. Post a solution with >83% accuracy before moving on to the next challenge.

# Hint
Start with scaling and imputing (inputting missing values with either the mean or median of the data) and search for other components for tweaking the data. For great percentages, try using a GridSearch
